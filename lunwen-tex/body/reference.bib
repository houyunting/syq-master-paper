abstract = {Chaotic signal is a non-stationary signal that has many peaks and mutations. Existence of noise influences seriously useful information to be extracted. De-noising is more necessary, especially when chaotic signals are polluted by noise. Fundamental wavelet is equal to a group of band-pass filter, different scale signals and different frequency signals are separated by different band channel. Wavelet analysis is local transformation of time and frequency, which can effectively extract information from the noise. This issue will be dealt with chaos signals. The wavelet transform was proposed to removal the noise from chaotic signals in order to detect chaotic signals. copy; 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to perform independent component analysis (ICA) for convolved mixtures. This approach is based on filter banks, and a simplified network efficiently performs ICA with decimated signals in each subband. Decimation provides much less computational complexity and faster convergence speed than the time domain approach. Futhermore, the approach does not have a performance limitation of the frequency domain approach, and it is able to select the number of filters in the filter bank regardless of reverberation. With an oversampled filter bank, adaptive parameters can be adjusted without any information of other subbands, and the approach is suitable for parallel processing. We verify the effectiveness of the filter bank approach through simulations on adaptive noise cancelling. copy; 2003 IEEE.},
